package.json is the central configuration file for any Node.js project. It contains metadata like project name, version, author, and description.

It manages dependencies by listing all required packages under "dependencies" and development tools under "devDependencies".

It defines scripts (like start, test, build) which can be executed using npm run <script> to automate tasks.

It helps in version control and project consistency, ensuring the same package versions are installed across different systems.

npm install uses package.json to automatically install all required packages, making it essential for project setup, sharing, and deployment.
